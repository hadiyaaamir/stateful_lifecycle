# Lifecycle of a Stateful Widget

This Flutter application helps visualize the lifecycle of a stateful widget through three examples. The examples demonstrate different scenarios involving stateful widgets, parent-child relationships, and the impact of state changes on the widget tree.

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Widget
This example showcases a single stateful widget and its lifecycle. It illustrates the creation, initialization, build, state update, and disposal stages of the widget's lifecycle.

### Example 2: Parent-Child Relationship
In this example, a parent widget contains a child widget. The behavior of the widget tree is observed when the parent's value is changed, as well as when a value passed from the parent to the child is modified. Additionally, the scenario where the child widget is a constant is explored to understand the impact on the widget tree.

### Example 3: Inherited Widgets
The third example focuses on inherited parent and child widgets. It demonstrates how inherited widgets propagate data down the widget tree, ensuring efficient updates and avoiding unnecessary rebuilds.
